# Uploading Your Image:

## Step 1:
First, head over to [this site](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/edititem/767/3/):

```
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/edititem/767/3/
```

## Step 2: 
Select the artwork you want to upload under "Choose file".

If you used a website such as [Steam Design](https://steam.design) to get this, then it should be a file like Artwork_Middle & Artwork_Right_Top.

## Step 3:
Go to inspect element and click on console. If needed type "allow pasting"

## Step 4:
Enter this into the console & press enter.

```
$J('#image_width').val(1000).attr('id',''),$J('#image_height').val(1).attr('id','');
```

Essentially, that will just set the image width to 1000 pixels and the height to 1 pixel, allowing you to create a long, narrow image for display. 

## Step 5
Click the option to say that you own this artowrk, then you can save it.

# Adding Artwork:

## Which slots to use:
You should always put the large image on the left, and the skinny image on the top right.

## I can't see my image:
Your image will be displayed as a think black line. Don't worry, as said before, to steam the image is only 1px in height.

As you can see, I did infact mess up the spacing on the anime girl, however you get the point. It can be done.
